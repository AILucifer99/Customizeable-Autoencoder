# Customizeable-Autoencoder
An Autoencoder created from scratch for any sort of image generation purpose. The entire architecture is customizable as per the domain specific requirements. 

Working procedure

Firsly, create lets create an autoencoder, by running the command "python autoencoder.py". 

Secondly, the training of the created model must be performed via the command, "python train.py". 

Lastly, the analysis of the entire training and final testing inference is done via running the command, "python autoencoderAnalysis.py". 

Note - The entire code is customizeable as per the needs and thereafter one can apply the code accordingly.
